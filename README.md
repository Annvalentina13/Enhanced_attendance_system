# ðŸ“š Advanced Attendance Management System (Python + Tkinter + SQLite)

This project is a robust **Attendance Management System** built using **Python**, **Tkinter** for the GUI, and **SQLite** for persistent storage. It allows teachers or administrators to maintain daily attendance records, store them in a database, and view saved entries â€” all with a simple graphical interface.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Startup**  
   - Connects to `attendance.db` or creates it if not found.
   - Loads all registered student names from the database.

2. **Marking Attendance**  
   - For each student, select "Present" or "Absent" from the dropdown.
   - Attendance is stored against the selected date.

3. **Adding Students**  
   - Enter a new student's name.
   - If the name doesn't already exist, it is added to the database and the list refreshes.

4. **Viewing Attendance Records**  
   - You can load records for a specific date from the database into a table.
